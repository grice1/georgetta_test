      StudyGroupz came about as a way to help support
      collegiate and high school studentsâ€™ succeed in the classroom.
      StudyGroupz.com allows students to
      collaborate in groups to study, work on assignments/projects,
      and share knowledge with one another.
      Students can also create a support system with classmates
      and search for study coaches (tutors) at the collegiate level
      to tutor them in multiple subject areas.
      We, The StudyGroupz Team, stand firmly by our philosophy
      that there is nothing more powerful than intelligent minds working
      collectively to help each other succeed. So, invite your classmates and
      buddies (friends) to join and build a network focused on educational success!
    </p>

  <h2> Core Values</h2>

    <p> Integrity: We encourage all students to do honest work.
      Plagiarism is not acceptable by any means.
    </p>

    <p> Teamwork: We encourage all students to build a support
      network with other students to achieve success. Use your talents and
      intelligence to help another student cross the finish line.
    </p>

    <p> Excellence: We encourage all students to give 100% in the classroom as
      well as outside of the classroom. Work hard and reap the benefits.
    </p>

    <p> Fearlessness: We encourage all students to believe in themselves and
      never to doubt. The mind is powerful. If you believe, you can achieve.
